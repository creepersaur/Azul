### Code linker for Roblox.

## Introduction
Hey!
Have you ever wanted to seamlessly connect your file explorer files to Roblox? Well with Azul, you can do just that.
You're probably here because you have heard about this, seen documentation, or want an alternative to [Rojo](https://rojo.space).
Azul is way easier to use than Rojo, as there is almost no setup required.

## Quick Start
### Installation (1):
To start using Azul:
- Download the `Azul.exe` and `game` folder from the directory, or from the [releases](https://github.com/creepersaur/Azul/releases) page.
- Put both of these in a new folder (or one you already have).
- Install the [Azul](https://create.roblox.com/marketplace/asset/16046554691) studio plugin.

### Server (2):
Do this in order, since the server must be running before the plugin.
1. Run the server (open `Azul.exe`)
2. Open Roblox Studio and run the plugin by clicking the Open UI button in the `Plugins` tab.
3. Click "Connect" on the plugin's ui.

### Usage (3):
- In your folder, you should have a "game" folder, in the same directory as your Azul.exe. To access a file/folder in Roblox studio
- make a folder(s) with the same name (capitilization is important).
- add files

# Support
As of writing this, there are the following supported file formats:
### ModuleScript - `*.lua`
### Script - `*.server.lua`
### LocalScript - `*.local.lua`
### JSON (ModuleScript) - `*.json`
